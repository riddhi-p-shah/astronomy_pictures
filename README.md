# Adyen Android Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the coding challenge for Android developer candidates at Adyen. The task is to create an app using NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) API.

## Setup
1. Register for an [API key](https://api.nasa.gov/).
2. Add your API key to `app/ local.gradle` (see `local.gradle.example` for details).
3. Verify your API key by running `PlanetaryServiceTest`.
4. Create a local Git repository.

## Time Limit
We expect you to take around 4 hours to complete the assignment.
It doesn't need to be done in one sitting, but try to use the time limit to guide your decisions and prioritise what to focus on.

## Features
1. APOD List Screen:

- Create a list of APODs (images only, no videos)
- Implement ordering
  * By title (ascending)
  * By date (descending)
2. APOD Details Screen:

    <img src="screens/DetailScreen.png" alt="Detail Screen" width="300"/>
- Show detailed information about a single APOD
3. Error Handling:

- Implement error screens (e.g., API errors)

## Resources
- Color schemes and icons are available in the resources folder
- Screen mockups are provided in the `screens` folder

## Evaluation Criteria
We will assess:
* Feature functionality and user experience
  - Portrait and landscape orientations
  - API call optimizations
  - Adherence to provided designs
* Architecture & Code style
* Test coverage and quality
* Rationale / prioritization behind implementation decisions

## Submission
Include your Git repository (with history intact) in the final zip file.
